<h2 className="text-2sm">How does it work</h2>

<p>I always thought we understand best by examples, so we’ll start with snippets of code and take them apart afterwards.</p>

<p>In essence, the snippet above seems like an overcomplicated alternative to <code>path: &#39;something&#39;</code> ,
    but you can also glimpse possibilities. The matcher function receives an array of URL segments, which are the pieces
    composing a path, split by <code>/</code>. It must return <code>null</code> if no match is found, and an object with
    the consumed segments if we do find a match. Because I had a simple route, I let Angular know I consumed all the
    segments. If you have a scenario such as matching a parent route, you should only return the segments consumed by
    the parent route, allowing the children to match their own paths. The function also takes an argument for a `UrlSegmentGroup` and
    the route object definition, which I didn’t find a use case for, yet you might. </p>

</figure>

<p>Another thing you can do is add a property named <code>posParams</code> in the response, like in Fig. 2. The above is
    equivalent to <code>path: &#39;users/:userName&#39;</code> with the additional check that the user name should be an
    alphanumeric string. </p>

<p><strong>A note on the calling order:</strong> the matcher is called before any guard or resolver, and it <a
        href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/26081">currently gets called multiple times</a>. </p>

<h2>An example scenario</h2>

<figure>

<p>Let’s say the UI is a file browser, where you can navigate and select a disk, a folder and then a file to view or edit.
    Let’s also say that you want to save this state in the route, to navigate between files with cross-links, or link to
    a specific file from an external app. </p>

<p>When I encountered a similar scenario, the implementation in Fig. 3 was my first thought. As I found out soon enough,
    that doesn’t cut it. <code>MyComponent</code> got destroyed and recreated every time I navigated between routes.</p>

<p>This is because when the router matches a different route definition, it will execute that new definition, without
    performing additional checks such as matching the oncoming component against the current one.</p>

<h3>Use cases</h3>

<p>While using <code>UrlMatcher</code> is a powerful strategy and can be used for multiple scenarios, I think many people would benefit just from knowing it can be used to keep a component
    “alive” between navigations. </p>

Specific situations where you might use the `matcher`:

<strong>1. Validating parameter values</strong>

<p>When you want a parameter to have a particular structure (e.g.: exactly 32 characters, numbers only, GUID format) or you
    want to differentiate based on the parameter (e.g.: if the param starts with ‘RO’ you set the Country to Romania, and so
    on). While I didn’t detail this in Fig. 4, I included the <code>validateLocationSegments</code> that could check the
    exact format of our parameters. The function `extractparams` is supposed to add the positional params only if they are defined, and in the proper order (e.g.: we cannot have a selected file without having a selected disk)</p>

<strong>2. Ensuring parameter structure</strong>

<p>When you want a nested structure that can be “incomplete”, yet you want it to match a route and render the same
    component, like the “location” one described above. The rule for that would look like
    <code>location/:disk/:folder/:file</code>. </p>

<p>That’s it. </p>
