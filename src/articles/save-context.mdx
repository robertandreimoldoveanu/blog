<p>Computers have this feature built in, and it’s why you can get straight back to work the moment you open the lid of a MacBook. Why not apply it for our minds at work as well? </p>

<p>How many times have you come back to work on a Monday morning, saw you left VS Code open, a specific function highlighted, but had no recollection of what you were doing? Maybe you just found the way to fix a bug, but thought “that’s going to take at least an hour or two, I’ll just remember and implement this Monday”. </p>

<p>How many times has something similar happened after a long vacation? After a weekend? The next day? How about even after a lunch break? </p>

<p>Imagine climbing atop a mountain where you can see an enormous landscape. Maybe you even glimpse a deer, a falcon, a curious looking tree or rock, an interesting patch of land. You couldn’t think that from such a point you’ll ever have trouble seeing things clearly. But next time you hop on the same spot, a thick fog engulfs you. The sun may shine above the clouds for sure, but there’s no way you can see anything. </p>

<h2>Slowly catching up</h2>

<p>As the fog slowly dissipates over the course of the day, you start seeing some landmarks and strain your eyes from there. The solution you knew so well on Friday evening is barely a distant blurry shape right now. You start to walk towards it, hoping to grasp it better. The moment you get close enough, however, you get head-butted by a deadline boar - a mandatory form taking 5 minutes to complete. Oh, right, the form you said you’ll complete first thing in the morning before (or during, more like it) the daily standup meeting. </p>

<p>I like to be efficient, but my memory serves me poorly. It may have been David Allen or Tiago Forte who said “our brains are made for generating ideas, not storing them”. </p>

<p>Naturally, I dislike behaving like an old car attempting to start on a winter day, cranking my mind in search of details I should remember but don’t, taking a while to warm up. It’s wasted time and decreased efficiency. </p>

<h2>So, what can you do? </h2>

<p>As I started this piece, computers do it. Every time a computer goes to sleep, it saves the current state of everything - what applications you have opened, what state they are in, any unsaved work is kept, even the cursor stays where you left it. Many other systems do it, in fact.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this isn’t some groundbreaking method. I’m just bringing to awareness a simple idea. Whenever you end your work, be it before lunch-break, at the end of the day or week, open a document and type whatever it was that you were currently doing, leave some points for what you have to or should do on the next day. Leave comments in the code with a particular marker (I sometimes use <code>// NOTE</code> for this), whatever works for you. For some things I find recording a voice note much easier and clearer than putting the context in words. Use whatever fits your workflow and the inner workings of your mind best.</p>

<p>Think of this like a handover for your future self. If someone else had to take over your work on Monday, what would you tell them? </p>

<p>That’s it. </p>
