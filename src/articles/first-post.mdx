<h1 className="text-3xl mb-6">Why</h1>

The short version, as short as it can be while also making sense. This blog did not sprout from a single idea, but rather from grafting a dozen, from multiple pieces clicking together. I'll start a couple of threads and tie them up towards the end. It'll make sense, bear with me.

My thoughts have always been fickle and tangled, growing everywhere like weeds. I found the concept of a "digital garden", and it was a metaphor that stuck. It pointed towards the right direction, so I could finally take the right tools out of the shed. 

At work, I found myself implementing solutions either requiring poorly documented Angular features and (shockingly) not found among straightforward answers on StackOverflow, or consisting of use-cases not found anywhere online. I wanted to write them somewhere, so if anyone needs that kind of solution to find their way faster. 

In other instances, I let my mind wander and explore, uncovering new ways to use features, interesting quirks of a framework or the web in general. But these ventures always ended with the thought <em>"maybe they aren't documented because they're not so useful, why bother"</em> or <em>"what authority or knowledge do I have to talk about these things?"</em>

With different philosophical ideas, the same story. I saw connections between apparently opposing views, but doubted myself still - philosophy seems like a profound subject, and who was I to comment.

When you search about blogging online, they talk about having a niche. I didn't think I could ever fit all I want to talk about into a single category. Starting a blog for each of my niched interests felt like fighting the Hydra - cut one under the magnifying glass, two others sprout back.

When I did attempt to build a blog and see how it goes, I hit some form of resistance. A tingling to not use an available abstraction, but instead climb down a notch and implement the system from there. Recursivity then ensues and I end up blaming myself for not knowing assembly so I can <em>truly</em> start from scratch. This compulsion to overthink and overengineer any solution. I don't think there is a name for such a thing. In Taoist manner, I don't think it <em><strong>can</strong></em> be named.

A touch of sanity comes once in a while. I remember that I just want to get content out there, and I go back to a high-level framework or platform - rarely the same one I started with. Ideas have a funny way of branching off, and when they blend with other aspects of our lives, they become unrecognisable. 

Such it happened that I've been trying to build this blog for 7 months, each time with a different mindset or approach. I went from wanting a quick and easy Wordpress deploy, to using a Gatsby theme, to using NextJS and building from scratch, to implementing a vanilla JS system to load HTML snippets exported from Ulysses, and then back to Wordpress, to using Obsidian Publish instead and only now having landed on NextJS. With breaks of 2-4 weeks thrown in there due to ego depletion. 

And the one thing I hate the most isn't all this back and forth. It's that I never documented any step of my process. Documenting my thoughts and coding endeavours seems like a great tool to put in place and not hit the same problem twice. I only wish I started sooner.

I heard somewhere the term "dev log" and that was another piece clicking into place, another succesful graft.

This blog is an attempt at keeping a digital jungle as tidy as possible, a brave quest to document ideas, projects and thought-processes in a hope to help others, an experiment of rejecting the best practices and norms of sticking within a niche, a public constraint to deliver as opposed to eternally overthinking and reinventing the wheel. 

<h1 className="text-3xl mb-6">How</h1>

This blog is built from scratch using NextJS and deployed with Vercel. For styling I leverage Tailwind, but as you can see there isn't much of that, because I wanted to remove any distractions (for me during development, mostly, but also for reading).

<p>Thatâ€™s it. </p>
